                  <p>The bat is a bit like a table tennis paddle, only larger, heavier and more solid usually made from a piece of English Ash wood. The ball is made of hard rubber and is similar to a lacrosse ball in both size and texture.</p>

                  <h4><b>Pitch</b></h4>
                  <p>The pitch is a strip of grass usually around 21 yards long and 10-12 feet wide. A line is placed along the length of both sides to easily distinguish where the pitch ends and two concrete-based posts are placed where the opposing team would bowl from.</p>

                  <h4><b>Trap</b></h4>
                  <p>The trap is a rectangular mechanical device with a lever in the center and a 'trap' on the front. The lever works in the same way as a seesaw with a pivot point in the middle, the ball is placed at one end and the batter hits the opposite end to send the ball upwards. There is a flap at the front of the device known as the trap(More on this in the how to play section).</p>
