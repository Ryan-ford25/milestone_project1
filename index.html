                <h2>A brief history</h2>
                <p>Bat and Trap, is a traditional English bat-and-ball pub game, it has roots in Kent and is believed to be an ancestor of cricket. Although the exact origins of bat and trap are unknown, it can be traced back as far as the 13th century, 
                    and there is recorded evidence of it being played in the West Country in 1671 although many people believe that Kent has always been its true home.</p>

                            <p>The bat is a bit like a table tennis paddle, only larger, heavier and more solid usually made from a piece of English Ash wood. The ball is made of hard rubber and is similar to a lacrosse ball in both size and texture.</p>

                            <p>The pitch is a strip of grass usually around 21 yards long and 10-12 feet wide. A line is placed along the length of both sides to easily distinguish where the pitch ends and two concrete-based posts are placed where the opposing team would bowl from.</p>

                            <p>The trap is a rectangular mechanical device with a lever in the center and a 'trap' on the front. The lever works in the same way as a seesaw with a pivot point in the middle, the ball is placed at one end and the batter hits the opposite end to send the ball upwards. There is a flap at the front of the device known as the trap(More on this in the how to play section).</p>

                    <h3>Teams</h3>
                    <p>The game is played with two teams of 4-8 players(depending on how many people are available). The players of each team will take turns of bowling/batting. The bowling team will switch player for as long as the batter is in play and the batting team will switch players once the current batter is out.</p>

                    <h3>Batting</h3>
                    <p>The first player on the batting team would take there stand against the opposing team placing the ball onto the front end of the lever in the trap, then hitting the back end with the bat in order to send the ball upwards(almost like a self serve) and then
                        hit the ball down the pitch between the two posts.</p>

                    <h3>Bowling</h3>
                    <p>If the ball was successfully hit between the two posts then the first bowler will attempt to throw or roll the ball back underarm and hit the flap on the front of the trap. If they hit and knock the flap down then the batter has been "bowled" out and
                        the next batting team player takes their place.

                    <h3>Scoring</h3>
                    <p>In bat and trap points are classed as "runs". If the bowler failed to hit the trap down then the batter is awarded 1 run and they continue to bat until they are out. Batters can also get out if they hit the ball wide of the posts,
                        if they don't hit the ball hard enough and therefore come short of the posts or if the bowlers catch the ball before it hits the ground.

                    <h3>Winning</h3>
                    <p>The game is usually played in a best of 3 format with the winning team being the one that won the most legs. A leg is won by the team that scored to most runs within that leg before all batsman were out. </p>
